- Use a shared React demo-state provider with browser-local persistence for the visual-only prototype; no remote backend is permitted in this phase.
- Keep each content screen in a dedicated TanStack route with unique metadata and shared navigation; this makes every screen directly navigable.
- Preserve the supplied SVG art through reusable avatar, icon and sticker components, using global semantic color tokens for fidelity.
